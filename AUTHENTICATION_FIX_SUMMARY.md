# Authentication Issue Fix Summary

## Problem Description
Users can successfully register but immediately receive "Invalid email or password" error when trying to log in with the same credentials.

## Root Causes Identified & Fixed

### 1. Email Normalization Inconsistency ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: Email handling was inconsistent between registration and login forms
- Registration: No trimming/lowercasing
- Login: Only trimming, no lowercasing
- Auth Provider: No normalization

**Fix Applied**:
- Added consistent `email.trim().toLowerCase()` in both forms
- Added email normalization in AuthProvider for both signUp and signIn
- This ensures emails are stored and compared consistently

### 2. Better Auth Configuration ✅ ENHANCED
**Issue**: Missing password validation and debug logging
**Fix Applied**:
- Added explicit password length constraints (6-128 characters)
- Enabled debug logging for better troubleshooting
- Enhanced error handling

### 3. Database Connection Issues ✅ IMPROVED
**Issue**: Potential database connection problems
**Fix Applied**:
- Added connection pooling configuration
- Added connection timeout and retry logic
- Added database connection logging

### 4. Environment Configuration ✅ CREATED
**Issue**: Missing environment variables
**Fix Applied**:
- Created `.env.local` with proper configuration
- Added fallback values for development

## Files Modified

1. `src/components/auth/RegisterForm.tsx` - Email normalization
2. `src/components/auth/LoginForm.tsx` - Email normalization  
3. `src/components/providers/AuthProvider.tsx` - Email normalization + logging
4. `src/lib/auth.ts` - Password validation + debug logging
5. `src/db/index.ts` - Connection pooling + logging
6. `.env.local` - Environment configuration (created)

## Next Steps Required

### 1. Set Up Database
The application needs a real PostgreSQL database. Options:
- **Neon (Recommended)**: Free PostgreSQL hosting
- **Local PostgreSQL**: Install locally
- **Docker**: Run PostgreSQL in container

### 2. Update Environment Variables
Update `.env.local` with your actual database URL:
```
DATABASE_URL=your_actual_database_connection_string
```

### 3. Initialize Database Schema
```bash
npm run db:push
```

### 4. Test Authentication Flow
```bash
npm run dev
# Then test registration and login in browser
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. User registers with email "Test@Example.com"
2. Email is normalized to "test@example.com" before storage
3. User tries to login with "test@example.com" 
4. Email is normalized to "test@example.com" before comparison
5. Login succeeds because emails match exactly

## Debugging Tools Added

- Console logging in AuthProvider for signup/signin attempts
- Database connection logging
- Better Auth debug logging
- Database check script (`scripts/check-db.js`)

The core issue was email normalization inconsistency. With these fixes, the authentication flow should work correctly once a proper database is set up.
